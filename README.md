- 👋 Hi, I’m Ben Kelley!
- 👀 I’m interested in way too many things, haha.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to not overcommit to new projects and then have to quit (or half-ass) most of them later .
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web3 projects. Currently I'm mostly just lurking & learning. 
- 📫 How to reach me: Github DM
