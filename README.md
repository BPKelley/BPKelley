- 👋 Hi, I’m Ben Kelley!
- 👀 I’m a product manager, parent, music theater musician, computer gamer, and many other things. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning AI, both from a theory perspective, and also more practically: how can it improve my *daily* workflows?
- 💞️ I mostly just lurk and learn on Github. My actual code contributions have all been corporate closed-source.
